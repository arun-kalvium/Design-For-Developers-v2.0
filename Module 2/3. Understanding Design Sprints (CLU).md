<p>Take a good look around you at all of the objects you see. The chair you’re sitting on, the table you’re using, the computer you’re accessing this lesson from, the water bottle that might be beside you and so on. Every single one of these products started off as a design problem.</p>

<p>How does a design problem become an actual user-centric product? One answer is through a concept called  <strong>Design Sprints</strong>. This is an ideal introduction as you embark on your journey into the second module of this course - UX Design.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting talk on the design sprints that were part of Google I/O 2014.<br>

<p>Well, that’s a valid question.</p>
<p>Developers bring their technical knowledge and skills to the design sprint. This helps in evaluating the feasibility and viability of design ideas from a technical standpoint by asking relevant questions, and providing feedbacks to ensure that the proposed solutions align with technical constraints and possibilities.</p>
<p>Developers in a design sprint helps to assess the feasibility of proposed solutions, identify potential technical challenges, and suggest alternative approaches when necessary. Their expertise helps the team make informed decisions and find the most effective solutions.</p>
