<p>In today’s digital storm, developers have a crucial role in shaping and building innovative products. These products aim to cater user needs and carve out a unique space in the market. However, it’s important to note that not all products created achieve equal levels of success. In this lesson, we will be covering what makes a product to stand still and what makes one to slide and fall.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-‘good-digital-product’">What is a ‘good digital product’?</h2>
<p>A ‘Good Product’ is distinguished by its ability to effectively solving a problem. Ain’t all the products aims the same? Then what makes the difference?</p>
<p>There is more. A <strong>good</strong> digital product is characterized by several key attributes that contribute to its overall quality, satisfaction of the user, usability, inclusiveness, scalability, data security &amp; privacy, market performance and a lot more.</p>
<p>Here is what Jeff Weiner, Executive Chairman at LinkedIn says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffweiner08/">what makes a truly great product great</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-digital-products-fail">Why do digital products fail?</h2>
<p>According to Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, 30,000 new products are introduced to the market every year. And every year, 28,500 of them, or 95 percent, fail to make the cut.</p>
<p>According to Alan Cooper and Robert Reimann in the book  <a href="https://www.amazon.in/About-Face-2-0-Essentials-Interaction/dp/0764526413/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1PGRLG04H9RAD&amp;keywords=about+face&amp;qid=1664722668&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjAxIiwicXNhIjoiMC45NyIsInFzcCI6IjAuNzcifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=about+face%2Caps%2C621&amp;sr=8-6"><em>About Face</em></a>, there are 4 reasons digital products fail.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Misplaced priorities</strong>  in the product management and development teams</li>
<li><strong>Ignorance</strong>  about real users and what they want</li>
<li><strong>Conflicts of interest</strong>  when development teams do both designing and building of the user experience</li>
<li><strong>Lack of a design process</strong>  that could permit knowledge about user needs to be gathered and drive a holistic product development process</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s discuss each of these reasons in detail, with inputs inspired from Alan Cooper and Robert Reimann.</p>
<h3 id="misplaced-priorities">Misplaced priorities</h3>
<p>Digital products come into existence thanks to two camps in each company - marketers, and developers. Marketers are great at a few things - identifying a market opportunity, positioning a product, quantifying a market etc. What they’re not very good at is providing input into the product design process. Too often, their input becomes a list of features to be added/ removed from a product. Building an interactive product doesn’t come down to a list of hundred different features.</p>
<p>Developers are in charge of actually building the products. But they are focused on solving technical problems, writing code that’s efficient, following engineering practices, and meeting deadlines. If you notice,  <strong>understand the user needs</strong>  doesn’t figure in this list at all.</p>
<p>In fact, the two camps responsible for building digital products do not have  <em>understanding user needs</em>  are their primary responsibility. This is where digital products fail, to start with.</p>

<h3 id="ignorance-about-what-users-want">Ignorance about what users want</h3>
<p>A lot of technology products get built without much understanding of users. Of course, companies understand things like market segment, the average salary of users in that segment, their peculiar habits etc. But none of this comes close to identifying real user needs.</p>

<p>Take for example,  <a href="https://maestrolearning.com/blogs/amazon-fire-phone/">the Amazon Fire smartphone</a>. Yes, Amazon did launch a smartphone and it failed spectacularly. It had amazing 3D features and a gesture-based interface, but it failed in meeting basic user needs like using Google apps (even though it was an Android phone). Amazon stopped selling the phone in September 2015.</p>
<h3 id="conflicts-of-interest">Conflicts of interest</h3>
<p>In many organizations, developers end up being the people who also design products. Even if they don’t get their hands on actually drawing designs, they get to say what gets built and what doesn’t. But, developers have to choose between  <strong>ease of code</strong>  and  <strong>ease of use</strong>. And it’s natural to assume that they will choose the former.</p>
<p>This is another reason why digital products fail.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-a-design-process">Lack of a design process</h3>
<p>What organizations that build digital needs products need is a repeatable, predictable, and analytical process for ensuring  <strong>product desirability</strong>  - transforming an understanding of users into products that meet their professional, personal, and emotional needs. Some organizations with serial product successes do this well -  <em>Apple</em>  is a great example of this.</p>
<p>And designers come in to ensure this - by crafting user experience as well as getting feedback from the product team and users on their proposed solutions.</p>
<p>Organizations, whose digital products fail, get many things wrong - one thing being asking for proposed solutions from users themselves. This is wrong on many levels. Let’s consider this analogy. Imagine a patient who visits his doctor with acute stomach pain. “Doctor,” he says, “it really hurts. I think it’s my kidney. I have a benign tumour. You’ve got to take it out as soon as possible.” A responsible physician wouldn’t perform surgery based solely on a patient’s request. The patient can describe the symptoms, but it takes the doctor’s professional knowledge to make the correct diagnosis and prescribe the treatment. That’s how product design is also supposed to be.</p>
