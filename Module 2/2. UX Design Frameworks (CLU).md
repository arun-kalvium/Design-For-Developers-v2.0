<p>A framework is a process or an approach followed from the initial idea to the final launch of the product. It helps to streamline the process and helps you focus to solve the problems. Following a framework efficiently will make your product be successfull. There are many such processes/ techniques that organizations adopt. One of the most popular ones is the <strong>Design Thinking Process</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-design-thinking">Introducing Design Thinking</h2>
<p>Design thinking is a problem-solving method that focuses on understanding users, questioning assumptions, and coming up with creative solutions. It began in the realm of design but has now spread to various disciplines. Design thinking is characterized by its user-centric method that includes five different stages.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Empathize</strong>  - Understanding how your users think and feel is crucial in the process. This involves observing and engaging with users by conducting surveys to gain insights into their needs, desires, and challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Define</strong>  - Synthesize the information gathered during the empathize phase to define the core problem. This will help you set a clear goal for your product.</li>
<li><strong>Ideate</strong>  - The goal is to generate a wide range of ideas without any bias. This involves brainstorming, sketching, and encouraging creativity to explore potential solutions. The focus here should be on the quantity of ideas rather than evaluating or criticizing ideas immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Prototype</strong>  - This involves creating representations of the potential solutions generated in the ideation phase that includes the functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong>  - By testing prototypes with users, you may obtain feedback and insights. Testing helps in evaluating the effectiveness of solutions and identifying areas for improvement. This feedback loop enables designers to iterate and develop their designs in response to real-world user experience.</li>

<h2 id="other-frameworks">Other Frameworks</h2>
<p>Other than Design Thinking, there are few more frameworks that are followed by the the designers to build a successful products.</p>
<h3 id="user-centered-design-process">User-centered design process</h3>
<p>User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design approach that prioritises understanding users’ needs, behaviours, and preferences throughout the design process. It involves actively engaging users in the design and development of products, services, or systems to ensure that they meet their needs and expectations. Typically, the UCD process consists of the following key stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the users.</li>
<li>Specify the user needs.</li>
<li>Design the solutions.</li>
<li>Evaluate the solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Read <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html">more about the UCD process</a> here.</p>
<h3 id="the-five-elements-of-ux-design">The five elements of UX design</h3>
<p>The five elements of design, also known as the ‘five planes’ or ‘five layers’, are a method for understanding and designing user experiences. They provide a framework for considering various aspects of user experience design and ensuring a comprehensive and solid design solution. The following are the five elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Scope</li>
<li>Structure</li>
<li>Skeleton</li>
<li>Surface</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lean-ux">Lean UX</h3>
<p>Lean UX is an iterative and collaborative approach to user experience design influenced by Lean Startup and Agile development methodologies. Lean UX is ideal for fast-paced, uncertain, and dynamic environments where speed and flexibility are critical.<br>
Lean UX is characterized by 3 steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think</li>
<li>Make</li>
<li>Check</li>
</ol>
