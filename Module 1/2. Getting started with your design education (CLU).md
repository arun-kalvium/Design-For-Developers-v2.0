<p>A digital product refers to any product or service that is primarily delivered or accessed through electronic channels, such as the internet, mobile devices, or software platforms. It is created and distributed in digital format, without a physical presence.</p>
<h2 id="what-goes-into-designing-a-digital-product">What goes into designing a digital product?</h2>
<p>Designing a digital product involves a combination of various elements and considerations. Starting from user research to testing the final product, the design plays a crucial role. A good design will turn your product into highly accessible, useful and usable to the end user.</p>
<p>For example, here’s a screen from the Apple Music app.</p>
<p><img src="https://kq-storage.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Design+for+devs/Module+1/m1-clu2-i1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At the heart of it, it is a series of shapes, images, and text - arranged in a specific manner. This design of shapes in a specific manner would have come about through the designers having a few goals in mind. These are the business goals of the app, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get customers to create playlists and add songs</li>
<li>Have customers possess the ability to search for any music on the web and so on…</li>
</ol>
<p>There would have also been a focus on things like the readability of text, the exact words to be used, the colour patterns, the right icons/ images, the dimension of those images etc.</p>
<p>To be able to design good products, you need to go through an education that will help you understand the fundamental principles. This lesson is all about that.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-user-experience-ux-design">What is User Experience (UX) design?</h2>
<p>User Experience (UX) refers to the overall experience and satisfaction that a user has while interacting with a product, system, or service.</p>
<p>UX design aims to provide useful, enjoyable, and user-centered experiences that cater to the requirements and expectations of the target users. It involves understanding the users, their objectives, and the environment in which they will use the product, then designing to enhance their experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don Norman is a cognitive scientist and usability engineer who coined the term ‘User Experience’. Here is what he says about what UX is:</p>
<p>“User experience” encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.</p>

<h2 id="user-experience-ux--user-interface-ui">User Experience (UX) &amp; User Interface (UI)</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, user experience refers to the overall experience of a user interacting with a product, including how you feel, how efficient and how easy it was while using it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, user interface refers to the layout, structure, elements that the user see. User interface helps to guide the user through the product’s interface using interactive elements such as buttons, navigational elements, etc.</p>
<p>We can tell the difference. But UX and UI are inseparable as a process. Leaving them one behind another will cost the health of your product.</p>
