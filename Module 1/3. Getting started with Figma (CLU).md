<p>To start learning how to design, it all begins by picking up a design tool.  <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/ui-ux-design-tools">Here are some popular tools used by designers.</a></p>
<p>During this course, we will pick one tool - Figma - for doing all of our designs. It’s because of a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s free for individual use</li>
<li>It’s a web-based tool</li>
<li>It’s super-easy to learn for beginners</li>
</ol>
<p>After you finish learning how to design in Figma, you could of course try learning other tools.</p>
