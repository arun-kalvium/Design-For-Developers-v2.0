<p>Design helps to solve problems and find creative solutions to meet specific needs or goals. Design is not just about how things looks. It takes account of usability, user experience, functionality, sustainability and many more factors to add. It carries emotions and provides satisfaction to the end user.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-developers-learn-design">Why should Developers learn Design?</h2>
<p>So why design for developers, indeed? The goal of any developer is to build software products that users fall in love with. No one wants to build apps that the world forgets! To build a great user experience, learning how to design for a user is super important.</p>
<p>Typically in an Engineering team, a cycle called the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is followed - as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://kq-storage.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Design+for+devs/Module+1/m1-clu1-i1.png" alt=""><br>
In this process, there are multiple people involved - Product designers, Software Developers, Software Testers, Product Manager, Engineering Manager etc.</p>
<p>Typically, a product is designed by Product designers and that is shared with Software Developers - who will then take over the SDLC process from Stage 4 (Implementation). At this stage, a lot of design elements go lost in translation because of reasons such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Software Developer did not understand the user experience design in detail while building a component</li>
<li>The Product Designer did not think of whether a component designed on paper can actually be built in the time planned for the development.</li>
</ul>
<p>By knowing design, a Software Developer develops the superpower of knowing the design intention behind every product. This is bound to improve the quality of the product - since user experience is at the back of the developer’s mind.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-good-design">What is good design?</h2>
<p>Well, good design brings life to the product.</p>
<p>Good design makes a  product extremely useful, it brings satisfaction to the user while using it.</p>
<p>There is no formulae set to measure the ‘good design’. But, we do have  set of principles to achieve ‘good design’.</p>
<p>Dieter Rams is a renowned industrial designer who defined 10 principles to achieve a good design which are widely practised by many designers.</p>
